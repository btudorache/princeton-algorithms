## Introduction to algorithms

Cousera online course, Introduction to Algorithms [Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) created by Princeton University, taught by: *Kevin Wayne*, Senior Lecturer and *Robert Sedgewick*, Professor.

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.
